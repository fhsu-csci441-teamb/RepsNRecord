# RepsNRecord
RepsNRecord is a lightweight fitness logging application designed to help users consistently track their workouts. Unlike bulky fitness platforms, FitLog focuses on simplicity by allowing users to record exercises, weights, sets, and notes in a clean, journal-like interface.

The application leverages modern web technologies and freely available services to ensure accessibility and ease of use. Progress can be reviewed over time, and users may opt in to receive reminders or updates through email, SMS, or chat applications (e.g., Discord, Slack).

RnR will be considered successful if:

Users can reliably log their workouts (date, exercise, weights, notes).

Entries are stored securely and retrievable for progress tracking.

Optional reminders and progress notifications are delivered via the userâ€™s chosen method(s).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
